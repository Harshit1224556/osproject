🖥️ CPU Efficiency Algorithm
📌 Overview
The CPU Efficiency Algorithm project provides an interactive simulation of various CPU scheduling techniques. It helps visualize how different algorithms handle process execution, optimizing CPU utilization and performance.

🚀 Features
✔️ Supports multiple scheduling algorithms:

⏳ First Come First Serve (FCFS)

⏱ Shortest Job Next (SJN/SJF)

🔄 Round Robin (RR)

🎯 Priority Scheduling

🏢 Multilevel Queue Scheduling
✔️ Dynamic UI for real-time process visualization
✔️ Performance comparison based on turnaround time, waiting time, and response time
✔️ User-customizable input for process details

🛠 Technologies Used
🌐 HTML → Structure the web application

🎨 CSS → Styling and responsive design

⚡ JavaScript → Algorithm implementation and UI interactivity

🔧 Installation
1️⃣ Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpu-efficiency-algorithm.git
2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd cpu-efficiency-algorithm
3️⃣ Open index.html in your browser to start the simulation.

📊 Usage
1️⃣ Enter process details (arrival time, burst time, priority, etc.)
2️⃣ Choose a scheduling algorithm from the available options
3️⃣ Click "Run Simulation" to visualize process execution
4️⃣ Analyze performance metrics to compare efficiency

🔮 Future Enhancements
✨ More Scheduling Algorithms → Earliest Deadline First (EDF)
📊 Graphical Gantt Chart Representation
🌙 Dark Mode & Theme Customization
🖥 Backend Integration to save and analyze simulations
